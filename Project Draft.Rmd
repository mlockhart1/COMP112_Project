**THE NBA**

The NBA or the National Basketball Association (add background information here)
Talk about the significance of sports in general and how data science can help us understand trends and maybe make predictions (predictions about demographic trends) 



# About the data set:

Add some information about the data sets we used and how they were manipulated. Discuss the limitations of the data set (The years the data is collected and the variables they include) 


# What Questions do we want to explore?

* What trends can we see in relation to geography/demographics in terms of the United States and the world?

* Which states have the most players? And which states contribute the highest scores? (Games Played is the variable used to measure the composition of the league)

* Outside of the United States which countries/continents contribute the most players? (It will probably be easier in terms of visualization to group the countries into continents. European, Asian, Oceanic)

*Are there other questions that we can still answer? If we can find a data set about which countries watch the games it could be interesting to compare if those countries with the most players also have the most viewers.


# Answers!

International Graphics:
As our data has shown, the NBA has overall increased its international players since 1996. Though our data does not feature the 2017-18 and 2019-20 years, we found that in 2017-18 there were 42 countries represented and this number fell to 38 countries and territories for the 2019-20 season. For this 2019-20 it was noted that the most-represented countries were from Canada with 16 players, followed by Australia, France, Croatia, and Serbia respectively.  Canada saw a record six players selected in the NBA Draft 2019, surpassing the previous record for most draftees from a non-U.S. country which was five set by France in 2016. In our “Average Draft Position of Players per Country” visualization the two largest points are held by France and Canada demonstrating that they have the highest number of total players from the 1996-2016 seasons. Therefore, the data from the NBA Draft 2019 makes sense with our findings.  

We noticed that there was a significant increase in international players following 2000, and we wanted to explore why. We found that in 2000 the NBA had established a focus on their international outreach and created the program Basketball Without Borders (BWB). Basketball without Borders aims to “unite young basketball players to promote the sport and encourage positive social change in the areas of education, health, and wellness.” The organization brings in NBA players and coaches to train the top youth players from Asia, Europe, Latin America and Africa. Since its foundation this organization has reached more than 3,000 participants in 24 cities in 20 countries on 5 continents. Most impressively, 37 former Basketball Without Borders campers drafted into the NBA.

Because international participation was on the rise, we wanted to find out it international viewership was as well. We found that it was, but not in the way we would have expected. While it might be assumed that countries with the most players would have the highest viewership, this was not the case. Kevin Wang, writer for ESPN, noted this as well and stated that “while international fans have a special connection with players from their home countries, that's becoming less important for overall interest.” According to one study in 2014, just 25.5% of total viewership came from the United States with the Philippines, Brazil, Italy and France next on the list. Canada which has its own team, the Toronto Raptors, fell into sixth place overall. In 2017, Everaldo Marques, a sportscaster for ESPN, noticed a similar trend and said that viewership had significantly increased in Brazil compared with the year before, even without Brazilian players like Anderson Varejao and Leandro Barbosa representing the nation. Those in the field believe that although representation of different nations in the NBA is important, the growth in access to technology is the primary factor in the continued growth in viewership. 



# Further ways to explore

We could add suggestions about other things people could look into. Maybe comparing our data to other sports or to the WNBA. (Do we want to find a WNBA data set? I'm sure there are some out there that our similar to the data sets that we have.)

# Limitations:
A lot of data sets that would have been helpful to create visualizations were monetized, and therefore inaccessible to us. We included the data in our written analysis, but were unable to demonstrate the findings in helpful visualization. For example, we could not find any data sets that had international viewership.
