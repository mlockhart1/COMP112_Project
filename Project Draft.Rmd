**THE NBA**

The NBA or the National Basket Ball Assosiation (add background information here)
Talk about the significance of sports in general and how data science can help us understand trends and maybe make predictions?



# About the data set:

Add some information about the data sets we used and how they were manipulated 


# What Questions do we want to explore?

* What trends can we see in relation to geography in terms of the United States and world wide?

* Which states have the most players? And which states contribute the highest scores?

* Outside of the United States which countries contribute the most players?

*Are there other questions that we can still answer? If we can find a data set about which countries watch the games it could be interesting to compare if those countries with the most players also have the most viewers.


# Answers!

Add the graphics here with more description of what they mean and why they are significant.


# Further ways to explore

We could add suggestions about other things people could look into. Maybe comparing our data to other sports or to the WNBA.
